# AI playing Doom

### This project is part of my journey into learning about Artificial Intelligence. The AI is implemented using Deep Convolutional Q-Learning.

## I. Overview
The ai.py file is an Artificial Intelligence that can play Doom using the Deep Convolutional Q-Learning
The experience_replay.py file contains code that performs Experience Replay
The image_preprocessing.py file takes care of preprocessing images
The videos folder is empty at the very first place. Once we have executed the code, some video of the AI playing Doom will be added to this folder.

## II. Running
In this repo, I not only have all the .py files to run the project in a local IDE, but also include a .ipynb with a link to Google Colaboratory.
I actually encourage you to follow that link to go to Google Colaboratory and make a copy of the AI playing Doom file from there and then run your copy.
This method is much easier, since you can get rid of troubles with installing libraries and independencies to set up the Doom environment.

If you want to run the project in your own environment, be sure to set up gym and some packages to set up the environment from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

Note that while running the code, it may take a really long time to train the AI, so please be patient.
